# Wrangling OpenStreetMap data for Northeast Atlanta

I used Python to wrangle and audit OpenStreetMap data for Northeast Atlanta. I did this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

Check out the project's [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mikeharkin/northeast-atlanta-OSM/blob/master/northeast_atlanta_OSM.ipynb).
